                <li class="mb-1">I am an <span class="bolder-text">Assistant Teaching Professor of Data Science and Analytics</span> at <span class="bolder-text">Georgetown University</span>. I received my PhD in Political Science from Columbia University in 2022, with a <a href="#dissertation">dissertation</a> on quantitative approaches to studying the history of political thought. During the PhD I also worked as an Adjunct Instructor in NYU's <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Data Science</a>, and Research Assistant in Columbia's <a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Economics Department</a>.</li>
                <li class="mb-1">My research in <span class="bolder-text">political science</span> mainly pertains to the history of political thought and what I call "computational political theory" (Natural Language Processing + Network Analysis + Political Theory)</li>
                <li class="mb-1">My research in <span class="bolder-text">economics</span> focuses on empirical, text-analytic studies of monopsony and collective bargaining in modern and historical labor markets.</li>

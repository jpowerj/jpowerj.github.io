Hi, I'm Jeff Jacobs! I am an Assistant Teaching Professor of Data Science and Analytics at Georgetown University.

I post things here when my brain becomes obsessed with something and needs to get to the bottom of it (since otherwise I annoy friends and family with these things for days on end ðŸ˜œ).

If you are one of my students, however, you may be looking for my <a href='https://jjacobs.me/dsan-resources/' target='_blank'>DSAN Resources page</a>, where I post things that are relevant to Georgetown DSAN students. Otherwise, you can find more on my <a href='https://cs.stanford.edu/~jjacobs3' target='_blank'>academic homepage</a>!

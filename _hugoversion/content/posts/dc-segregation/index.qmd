Long story short, Pew Research used to have an incredible set of maps visualizing how extreme segregation is in DC, race-wise as well as socioeconomic. A screenshot from this old visualization shows what it looked like:

Unfortunately, all of these visualizations used MapBox, which seems to just totally not exist anymore (at least, these particular maps are long gone), so that when you try to [view these visualizations](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/income-segregation/washington-dc/){target='_blank'} on Pew's website nowadays, you just get a blank page.

So, in this document, I recreate the above maps, using open-source libraries in R to (hopefully) allow interactive visualization of this important information that will last longer than the previous versions in MapBox's proprietary format!
